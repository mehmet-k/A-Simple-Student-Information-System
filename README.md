# A-Simple-Student-Information-System
  It's a small scaled student information system which was my project for structural programming lesson. Can take inputs from local files and from console. Language of the current version is Turkish.

students.txt : Every line is the information of a student, inputs are seperated by comma ( "," ), respectively student number, name, surname, credits, assigned lessons. 
lessons.txt:  Every line is the information of a lesson, inputs are respectively lesson code, lesson name, capacity credits. 
lesson_reg.txt : Every line is the information of a process, inputs are seperated by comma ( "," ), respectively process order, lesson code, number of registered                          student, process date, process type. Date is not implemented yet.

  Also there will be additional file about lessons that single student assigned, named as student_number.txt. There is an example file named as 2000000.txt in the main file.
